<a href="#signature" class="anchor"></a>Signature</h3>
<p>There are multiple types of enrichment analyses (e.g.Â hypergeometric, kstest, gsea) one can perform. Depending on the type, different kinds of signatures are expected. There are three types of signatures <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hypeR.html">hypeR()</a></code> expects.</p>

<p>A geneset is simply a list of vectors, therefore, one can use any custom geneset in their analyses, as long as itâ€™s appropriately defined. Additionally, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hypeR.html">hypeR()</a></code> recognized object oriented genesets called <code>gsets</code> objects, described later.</p>

<p>Using a differential expression dataframe created with Limma, we will extract a signature of upregulated genes for use with a <em>hypergeometric</em> test and rank genes descending by their differential expression level for use with a <em>kstest</em>.</p>

<a href="#enrichment-methods" class="anchor"></a>Enrichment Methods</h2>
<p>All workflows begin with performing enrichment with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hypeR.html">hypeR()</a></code>. Often weâ€™re just interested in a single signature, as described above. In this case, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hypeR.html">hypeR()</a></code> will return a <code>hyp</code> object. This object contains relevant information to the enrichment results, as well as plots for each geneset tested, and is recognized by downstream methods.</p>
<p>The most basic signature is an unranked vector of genes. This could be a differential expression signature, module of co-expressed genes, etc. As an example, we use the differential expression dataframe to filter genes that are upregulated (t &gt; 0) and are sufficiently significant (fdr &lt; 0.001), then extract the gene symbol column as a vector.</p>

<p>Rather than setting a specific cutoff to define a differential expression signature, one could rank genes by their expression and provide the entire ranked vector as signature. From the differential expression dataframe, we order genes descending so upregulated genes are near the top, then extract the gene symbol column as a vector.</p>

<p>In addition to providing a ranked signature, one could also add weights by including the t-statistic of the differential expression. From the differential expression dataframe, we order genes descending so upregulated genes are near the top, then extract and deframe the gene symbol and t-statistic columns as a named vector of weights.</p>

<p>A <code>hyp</code> object contains all information relevant to the enrichment analysis, including the parameters used, a dataframe of results, plots for each geneset tested, as well as the arguments used to perform the analysis. All downstream functions used for analysis, visualization, and reporting recognize <code>hyp</code> objects and utilize their data. Adopting an object oriented framework brings modularity to hypeR, enabling flexible and reproducible workflows.</p>

<p>When dealing with hundreds of genesets, itâ€™s often useful to understand the relationships between them. This allows researchers to summarize many enriched pathways as more general biological processes. To do this, we rely on curated relationships defined between them.</p>
<div id="relational-genesets" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#relational-genesets" class="anchor"></a>Relational Genesets</h3>
<p>For example, <a href="https://reactome.org/">Reactome</a> conveniently defines their genesets in a <a href="https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/">hiearchy of pathways</a>. This data can be formatted into a relational genesets object called <code>rgsets</code>.</p>

<p>Relational genesets have three data atrributes including gsets, nodes, and edges. The <code>genesets</code> attribute includes the geneset information for the leaf nodes of the hiearchy, the <code>nodes</code> attribute describes all nodes in the hierarchy, including internal nodes, and the <code>edges</code> attribute describes the edges in the hiearchy.</p>

<p>One can visualize the top enriched genesets using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hyp_hmap.html">hyp_hmap()</a></code> which will return a hiearchy map. Each node represents a geneset, where the shade of the gold border indicates the normalized significance of enrichment. Hover over the leaf nodes to view the raw value. Double click internal nodes to cluster their first degree connections. Edges represent a directed relationship between genesets in the hiearchy. Note: This function only works when the <code>hyp</code> object was inialized with an <code>rgsets</code> object.</p>

<p>Often computational biologists must process, interpret, and share large amounts of biological data. A common example is interpreting gene co-expression modules across one or more phenotype, resulting in potentially hundreds of signatures to annotate. Here we have signatures of gene co-expression modules, generated with WGCNA, for multiple breast cancer subtypes</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Annotate gene co-expression modules across one or more phenotype, resulting in potentially hundreds of signatures to annotate. ## Example Data</p>
<p>Weâ€™re using publicly available RNA-seq data from breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The data has been normalized with DESeq2, log-transformed, and subtyped using PAM50 signatures.</p>

<p>We can feed <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hypeR.html">hypeR()</a></code> one or more signatures. In the case of multiple signatures, a <code>multihyp</code> object will be returned. This object is essentially just multiple <code>hyp</code> objects. However it is recognized and handled differently by downstream methods. Lets start by annotating signatures for the first subtype.</p>

<p>Often researchers need to annotate multiple signatures across multiple experiments. Typically, the best way to manage this data is to process it all at once and generate a markdown report to analyze and share with collaborators. Letâ€™s take an example where we have one experiment with many signatures.</p>
<p>In the current example, we want to annotate dozens of co-expression modules for multiple breast cancer subtypes. We have included some convenient functions that return some html for turning <code>hyp</code> and <code>mhyp</code> objects into concise tables for markdown documents. These tables can also include some plots for each individual <code>hyp</code> object.</p>

<p>Alright, how about we process all of these nested signatures and provide an example of what your markdown report might look like. Because we have a nested list of signatures, we use <code>hyper()</code> with the <code>lapply</code> function. This results in a list of <code>mhyp</code> objects.</p>

<p>For quick report generation one can use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hyp_to_rmd.html">hyp_to_rmd()</a></code> which will accept multiple formats, including a single <code>hyp</code> or <code>multihyp</code> object as well as a list of either, including a list of <code>hyp</code> or <code>multihyp</code> objects together. When a list of <code>multihyp</code> objects are passed for example, each experiment will become its own section, while each signature becomes its own tab within that section. Lists of keyword arguments can be passed for <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hyp_dots.html">hyp_dots()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hyp_emap.html">hyp_emap()</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hyp_hmap.html">hyp_hmap()</a></code>, allowing customization of their functionality per report. See <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hyp_to_rmd.html">hyp_to_rmd()</a></code> for details.</p>

<a href="#shiny-modules" class="anchor"></a>Shiny Modules</h1>
<p>All <strong>hypeR</strong> methods output objects that are compatible with R Shiny and can be incorporated into a variety of applications (e.g. <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/hyp_dots.html">hyp_dots()</a></code> returns a <code>ggplot</code> object). The most difficult challenge in incorporating geneset enrichment tasks in Shiny applications is the geneselect selection / fetching itself. To help with this, <strong>hypeR</strong> includes module functions that abstract away the geneset selection code.</p>
<div id="what-are-shiny-modules" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#what-are-shiny-modules" class="anchor"></a>What Are Shiny Modules?</h2>
<p>Shiny modules are functions that generato Shiny UI / Server code. They are composable elements that can be used within and interface with existing applications. For more information, check out the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html">latest documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="example" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#example" class="anchor"></a>Example</h2>
<p>For those familiar with Shiny, you will have accompanying modules for the ui and server sections of your application. These modules are <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/genesets_UI.html">hypeR::genesets_UI()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/hypeR/man/genesets_Server.html">hypeR::genesets_Server()</a></code> respectively.</p>
<div id="ui" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#ui" class="anchor"></a>UI</h3>
<p>Here we create a simple interface where we use the genesets selection module. Through that module, users can select genesets available through <strong>hypeR</strong> and the application will load those genesets into a <em>reactive variable</em> (more on this later). We add additional code to take a user-defined gene signature and produce an enrichment plot which represents components specific to your Shiny application. This can be anything!</p>

<p>Now we need to create the server code that is responsible for all the backend work. Again, we provide an associated module function for the server code. The serve code returns a <em>reactive variable</em> containing the fetched genesets that were selected. <strong>Selection changes will update this variable and propogate to downstream functions</strong>. Importantly, this variable holding the genesets can be accessed by any part of your application now, enabling you to make applications completely customizable while still utilizing this feature. As an example, our custom function is producing a simple enrichment plot.</p>
